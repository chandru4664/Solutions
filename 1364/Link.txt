Learn Scala Programming language from Scratch
Learn everything you need to know about the popular Scala language with this comprehensive tutorial
https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/learn-scala-programming/9781787126299/

Scala Programming Language
You'll learn basic proficiency with using Scala. It's a great tool to add to your programming toolbox. 
Learning Scala will demonstrate your ability to grasp a functional programming language. If you don't already know any 
functional programming languages, Scala is certainly a popular one to know. We'll use the Eclipse Scala IDE though out 
this course. Some of the topics covered will be language fundamentals, control flow, functions, classes, file I/O and 
exception handling. The course is well placed for those that do not have any Java or functional programming background. 
Each module ends with a project so you can challenge yourself with new material and solidify what you've learned.

Practical Scala for Java Developers
You're a Java developer who has heard of Scala and maybe now you're being asked to work on Scala code. 
Concerned? Don't be. Taught by Java-Scala experts Ben Evans and Julian Templeman, this courseanswers the 
questions you want answered: What is Scala really useful for? Does it help with concurrency? What is functional 
programming and how much do I really need to know? How do I set up a Scala development environment, how do I test, 
and what are the must-know Scala idioms? If you're an intermediate level Java developer with six months of experience
under your belt, then this course will quickly transform you from the Scala ignorant to the Scala capable.

KAFKA

Introduction to Apache Kafka
Currently one of the hottest projects across the Hadoop ecosystem, Apache Kafka is a distributed, real-time data system 
that functions in a manner similar to a pub/sub messaging service, but with better throughput, built-in partitioning, 
replication, and fault tolerance. In this video course, host Gwen Shapira from Cloudera shows developers and administrators 
how to integrate Kafka into a data processing pipeline.

You'll start with Kafka basics, walk through code examples of Kafka producers and consumers, and then learn how to integrate 
Kafka with Hadoop. By the end of this course, you'll be ready to use this service for large-scale log collection and stream 
processing.

Learning Path: Kafka

Currently one of the hottest projects across the Hadoop ecosystem, Apache Kafka is a distributed, real-time data system 
that functions in a manner similar to a pub/sub messaging service, but with better throughput, built-in partitioning, 
replication, and fault tolerance. In this video course, host Gwen Shapira shows developers and administrators the basics 
for setting up a Kafka cluster and writing producers and consumers in Kafka.

The Ultimate Hands-on Hadoop
•Design distributed systems that manage "big data" using Hadoop and related technologies.
•Use HDFS and MapReduce for storing and analyzing data at scale.
•Use Pig and Spark to create scripts to process data on a Hadoop cluster in more complex ways.
•Analyze relational data using Hive and MySQL
•Analyze non-relational data using HBase, Cassandra, and MongoDB
•Query data interactively with Drill, Phoenix, and Presto
•Choose an appropriate data storage technology for your application
•Understand how Hadoop clusters are managed by YARN, Tez, Mesos, Zookeeper, Zeppelin, Hue, and Oozie.
•Publish data to your Hadoop cluster using Kafka, Sqoop, and Flume
•Consume streaming data using Spark Streaming, Flink, and Storm
