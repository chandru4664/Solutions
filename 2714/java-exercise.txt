1. Choose the correct statements about method overriding
a. public methods can be overridden as protected methods -correct
	- a private method cannot be overridden since it is not visible from any other class. 
b. Overridden method cannot throw any exception if super class method does not throw any
	- The overriding method must not throw new or broader checked exceptions.
c. Overridden methods can change parameters
	- In case of method overriding, parameter must be same.
d. Final access specifier for method means all parameters are final.

Ans: b


Overridden - super class
Overriding - sub class

c) A StringBuffer's contents can be modified while the contents of a String can't be modified, are immutable.
	- StringBuffer class is mutable. String class is immutable.
d) All String objects must be initialized with constant values at compile time while StringBuffer’s can be defined later.

Ans:c

a. Necessarily be an abstract class
b. Should have the method public abstract void someMethod ()
c. Should have the method public abstract void someMethod () that throws an exception

d. Should have the method public void someMethod () which need not throw an exception

Ans: d
